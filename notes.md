# Notes

## Chapter 1

- have a todo list to keep us focused
- don't interrupt yourself, add an item to the todo list

## Chapter 2

TDD cycle:

- Write a test
- Make it run
- Make it right

> Clean code that works is out of the reach of even the best programmers some of the time, and out of the reach of most programmers most of the time. Divide and conquer, baby. First we'll solve the “that works” part of the problem. Then we'll solve the “clean code” part. 

Strategies to make a test green:

- Fake it - Return a constant and gradually replace constants with variables until you have the real code.
- Use obvious implementation. - Type in the real implementation.
